## Lessons Learned & Next Steps

Excuse my language and to quote one of my Educators, "Shit takes time". This capstone has really taught my how to use my time wisely and to focus on the important and bigger functions at hand before diving into the finer details (styling). Through this project I have solidified what I have learned in BrainStation, as well as learning how to implement Socket.io! For my next steps, I would love to use SQL instead of JSON file for data retention.
    
## Acknowledgements 

I would like to dedicate this section to thank all my Educators, TA's, and classmates for this amazing journey. I couldn't have done this without everyone's support. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and I wish all the best to everyone!
